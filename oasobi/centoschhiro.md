"Always, countless times, in the depths of my heart, I want to dream, even though the sadness is immeasurable. 
Beyond that, surely, I can meet you. With each repeating mistake, people only come to know the blueness of the blue sky. 
The endless road stretches out before me, but these hands can embrace the light. 
The quiet chest at the time of farewell becomes zero, but listen carefully; living is mysterious, 
dying is mysterious. Flowers, wind, the town, everything is the same, la la la la la la la. 
In the depths of my calling heart, always, countless times, I want to dream. Instead of counting the sorrows, 
let's sing softly with the same lips. In the closing memories, I always want to hear the whispers I never want to forget. 
Even on the shattered mirror, new scenery is reflected. In the quiet window of the morning of the beginning, the body becomes zero, but keep filling up. 
Beyond the sea, I won't search anymore. What shines is always here, found within me. La la la la la la la."
